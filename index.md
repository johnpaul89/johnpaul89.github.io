### Machine Learning/ Spatial Analytics With python

### [Eurosat Land Use and Land Cover Classification Using Deep Learning](/pdf/Eurosat_Land_Use_and_Land_Cover_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning.pdf)

Human activities on earth have caused rapid changes on land cover over the last decades. Monitoring land cover changes is important to understand the relationship between man and nature to provide decision makers with relevant information. This project I attempted to find high accuracy in classifying Eurosat satellite images using deep learning algorithms.

### Machine Learning/ Spatial Analytics with R

### [Space Time Prediction - Re-balancing Bike Demands](pdf/space-time-prediction-re-balancing-bike-demands.html)

A bike share program is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price. This project developed a method of predicting bike share trips in Manhattan Island, with emphasis on bike share demand. This document outlines the motivation for this project, exploratory analysis, feature engineering and model building.

#### Skill used: R, Linear Regressions


### [Gentrification Prediction in Philadelphia](pdf/gentrification-prediction-in-philadelphia.html)

I built a geospatial risk model in R that predicts gentrification in Philadelphia. Gentrification is displacement of long term residents in neighborhoods who are "priced out" by the new cash flow and attraction of the area. Predictors such as Starbucks locations, eviction filings and grocery store access are used in my model.

#### Skill used: R, Poisson Regression

### Spatial Analytics with Google Earth Engine

### [Mapping Lake Naivasha Expansion Using Google Earth Engine](pdf/Environmental_Change_of_Lake_Naivasha_and_its_Surrounding_Areas-merged.pdf)

Lake Naivasha is expanding and it has enormous implications for the regions surrounding it. River Malewa and Gilgil river flow into the Lake and carry large sediments into the lake in the rainy season. Using Google Earth Engine I mapped and calculated the expansion of the lake with its environmental effects.
